<p>My name is Colin Brown, an MS student in Physics at San Diego State University. This page contains a record of my contributions
to Luque Lab and
the ongoing development of my Master’s Thesis. I primarily analyze the structural and geometric properties of viral capsids with 
coarse grained physical models.</p>

<h2 id="classifying-viral-capsids-via-quasi-rigid-domain-decomposition">Classifying Viral Capsids via Quasi-Rigid Domain Decomposition</h2>

<p><img src="dd.png" alt="myimg" /></p>

<p>I am developing a tool based on the work in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212615002270?via%3Dihub">Ponzoni &amp; Polles 2015</a>
that uses Normal Mode Analysis and Elastic Network Models to decompose a protein structure into its quasi-rigid subunits.
I am applying this tool to capsids and using the results to assist in the classification of capsids using the scheme
described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12367-3">Twarock &amp; Luque(2019)</a>.
The details of this method are included in Chapter 4 of my thesis and the project is located in a 
<a href="https://github.com/luquelab/mechanical_subdivision_ProDy">Github Repository.</a></p>

<h2 id="catalogue-of-capsid-classifications">Catalogue Of Capsid Classifications</h2>

<p><img src="fig.png" alt="myimg" /></p>

<p>I am part of a group effort in Luque Lab to create a catalogue of classifications of Viral Capsids based on their geometry.
This project is ongoing at this <a href="https://github.com/luquelab/auto-lattice">Github Repository.</a></p>

<h2 id="chimerax-hkcage">ChimeraX hkcage</h2>

<p><img src="snub.gif" alt="snub" /></p>

<p>I developed a tool for the free molecular visualization software <a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/">ChimeraX</a>. The
tool was an extension of the ‘hkcage’ tool already present in ChimeraX to generate Geodesic &amp; Goldberg Polyhedra to a
set of new geometries described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12367-3">Twarock &amp; Luque(2019)</a>. This tool
is now part of the official ChimeraX Toolshed. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12367-3">ChimeraX Documentation.</a>)
The tool is also being developed and documented in a <a href="https://github.com/luquelab/hkcage">Github Repository.</a></p>

<h2 id="coarse-grained-models-of-viral-capsids">Coarse Grained Models Of Viral Capsids</h2>

<p><img src="toy_model.png" alt="cg" /></p>

<p>I created coarse grained toy models of capsids based on those used in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/101/44/15556">Zandi &amp; Reguera 2004</a>
for the purpose of comparing standard hexagonal capsid structures with trihexagonal capsid structures.</p>
