My name is Colin Brown, an MS student in Physics, and this repository contains a record of my contributions to the lab and
the development of my thesis. I primarily analyze the structural properties of viral capsids with coarse grained models.
The majority of the content here will be a part of my Masters Thesis in Physics.

## 1. Thesis Outline

### 1.1 Introduction To Icosahedral Capsids

### 1.2 Geometry Of Icosahedral Capsids

### 1.3 Coarse Grained Models Of Capsid Geometries

### 1.4 Quasi Rigid Domain Decompostion Of Viral Capsids

#### 1.4.1 Geometry Of Quasi Rigid Subunits

#### 1.4.2 Normal Mode Analysis

#### 1.4.3 Elastic Network Models

#### 1.4.4 Spectral Clustering

#### 1.4.5 Implementation On HPC Cluster

#### 1.4.6 Results

### 1.5 Discussion & Conclusion

#### 1.5.1-3 Results Of Each Chapter

#### 1.5.4 Synthesis Of Results

#### 1.5.5 Computational Improvements
