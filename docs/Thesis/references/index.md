Abstract: Summary
Identifying dynamical, quasi-rigid domains in proteins provides a powerful means for characterizing functionally oriented structural changes via a parsimonious set of degrees of freedom. In fact, the relative displacements of few dynamical domains usually suffice to rationalize the mechanics underpinning biological functionality in proteins and can even be exploited for structure determination or refinement purposes. Here we present SPECTRUS, a general scheme that, by solely using amino acid distance fluctuations, can pinpoint the innate quasi-rigid domains of single proteins or large complexes in a robust way. Consistent domains are usually obtained by using either a pair of representative structures or thousands of conformers. The functional insights offered by the approach are illustrated for biomolecular systems of very different size and complexity such as kinases, ion channels, and viral capsids. The decomposition tool is available as a software package and web server at spectrus.sissa.it.

AB Motivation: The Anisotropic Network Model (ANM) is a simple yet powerful model for normal mode analysis of proteins. Despite its broad use for exploring biomolecular collective motions, ANM has not been systematically evaluated to date. A lack of a convenient interface has been an additional obstacle for easy usage.Results: ANM has been evaluated on a large set of proteins to establish the optimal model parameters that achieve the highest correlation with experimental data and its limits of accuracy and applicability. Residue fluctuations in globular proteins are shown to be more accurately predicted than those in nonglobular proteins, and core residues are more accurately described than solvent-exposed ones. Significant improvement in agreement with experiments is observed with increase in the resolution of the examined structure. A new server for ANM calculations is presented, which offers flexible options for controlling model parameters and output formats, interactive animation of collective modes and advanced graphical features.Availability: ANM server ()Contact:bahar@ccbb.pitt.edu
