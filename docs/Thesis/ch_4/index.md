# Chapter 4: Quasi Rigid Domain Decompostion Of Viral Capsids

## 4.1: Augmenting The Classification Scheme
The ambiguities of the classification scheme described in chapter 2 gives us the opportunity to include additional
assumptions that encode structural information about the capsid. Here we propose that the classification scheme be 
augmented with the following assumption.

*Assumption: Capsomers correspond to quasi rigid domains of a viral capsid*

Here we use the same definition of a quasi rigid domain as described in [ref] 

$$
\begin{equation}
    E = mc^2 
\end{equation}
