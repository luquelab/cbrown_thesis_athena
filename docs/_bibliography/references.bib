   abstract = {Tailed phages are the most abundant and diverse group of viruses on the planet. Yet, the smallest tailed phages display relatively complex capsids and large genomes compared to other viruses. The lack of tailed phages forming the common icosahedral capsid architectures T = 1 and T = 3 is puzzling. Here, we extracted geometrical features from high-resolution tailed phage capsid reconstructions and built a statistical model based on physical principles to predict the capsid diameter and genome length of the missing small-tailed phage capsids. We applied the model to 3348 isolated tailed phage genomes and 1496 gut metagenome-assembled tailed phage genomes. Four isolated tailed phages were predicted to form T = 3 icosahedral capsids, and twenty-one metagenome-assembled tailed phages were predicted to form T < 3 capsids. The smallest capsid predicted was a T = 4/3 ≈ 1.33 architecture. No tailed phages were predicted to form the smallest icosahedral architecture, T = 1. We discuss the feasibility of the missing T = 1 tailed phage capsids and the implications of isolating and characterizing small-tailed phages for viral evolution and phage therapy.},

abstract = {Tailed phages are viruses that infect bacteria and are the most abundant biological entities on Earth. Their ecological, evolutionary, and biogeochemical roles in the planet stem from their genomic diversity. Known tailed phage genomes range from 10 to 735 kilobase pairs thanks to the size variability of the protective protein capsids that store them. However, the role of tailed phage capsids’ diversity in ecosystems is unclear. A fundamental gap is the difficulty of associating genomic information with viral capsids in the environment. To address this problem, here, we introduce a computational approach to predict the capsid architecture (T-number) of tailed phages using the sequence of a single gene—the major capsid protein. This approach relies on an allometric model that relates the genome length and capsid architecture of tailed phages. This allometric model was applied to isolated phage genomes to generate a library that associated major capsid proteins and putative capsid architectures. This library was used to train machine learning methods, and the most computationally scalable model investigated (random forest) was applied to human gut metagenomes. Compared to isolated phages, the analysis of gut data reveals a large abundance of mid-sized (T = 7) capsids, as expected, followed by a relatively large frequency of jumbo-like tailed phage capsids (T ≥ 25) and small capsids (T = 4) that have been under-sampled. We discussed how to increase the method’s accuracy and how to extend the approach to other viruses. The computational pipeline introduced here opens the doors to monitor the ongoing evolution and selection of viral capsids across ecosystems.}

Bacteriophages, viruses specific to bacteria, regulate bacterial communities in all known microbial systems. My research aims to determine how they interact with the trillions of bacteria found in the human gut. To do this, I apply a whole-systems perspective on both communities, considering bacteriophage replication cycles, bacterial and bacteriophage diversity, temporal dynamics, interactions, and responses to perturbations. Building upon ecological concepts and an array of independent and complementary techniques, I study the human gut from a microbial perspective. In contrast with bacteria, working with bacteriophage communities comes with many significant challenges, starting with the limited experimental toolkit and curated databases. Yet an increasing number of studies are pushing these scientific boundaries every day. In the human gut, future research that includes bacteriophages will lead to many exciting and warranted research avenues. From phage therapy and immunization to targeted drug delivery, the sky is the limit in my opinion. }

abstract = {Viral activity exerts a particularly important role in the dark ocean across the global tropical and subtropical oceans. Viruses are a key component of marine ecosystems, but the assessment of their global role in regulating microbial communities and the flux of carbon is precluded by a paucity of data, particularly in the deep ocean. We assessed patterns in viral abundance and production and the role of viral lysis as a driver of prokaryote mortality, from surface to bathypelagic layers, across the tropical and subtropical oceans. Viral abundance showed significant differences between oceans in the epipelagic and mesopelagic, but not in the bathypelagic, and decreased with depth, with an average power-law scaling exponent of −1.03 km−1 from an average of 7.76 × 106 viruses ml−1 in the epipelagic to 0.62 × 106 viruses ml−1 in the bathypelagic layer with an average integrated (0 to 4000 m) viral stock of about 0.004 to 0.044 g C m−2, half of which is found below 775 m. Lysogenic viral production was higher than lytic viral production in surface waters, whereas the opposite was found in the bathypelagic, where prokaryotic mortality due to viruses was estimated to be 60 times higher than grazing. Free viruses had turnover times of 0.1 days in the bathypelagic, revealing that viruses in the bathypelagic are highly dynamic. On the basis of the rates of lysed prokaryotic cells, we estimated that viruses release 145 Gt C year−1 in the global tropical and subtropical oceans. The active viral processes reported here demonstrate the importance of viruses in the production of dissolved organic carbon in the dark ocean, a major pathway in carbon cycling.}}

The procapsid is a metastable state that increases in stability as a result of morphological changes that occur during the dsDNA packaging reaction. We review evidence from several systems indicating that proper contacts acquired in the assembly of the procapsid are critical to forming the correct morphology in the mature capsid.}

Auxiliary proteins or Δ-domains strictly control assembly of multiple, identical, HK97-like subunits into procapsids with specific icosahedral symmetries, rather than aberrant non-icosahedral structures. Procapsids are precursor structures that mature into capsids in a process involving release of auxiliary proteins (or cleavage of Δ-domains), dsDNA packaging, and conformational rearrangement of the HK97-like subunits. Some coat proteins built on the ubiquitous HK97-fold also have accessory domains or loops that impart specific functions, such as increased monomer, procapsid, or capsid stability. In this review, we analyze the numerous HK97-like coat protein structures that are emerging in the literature (over 40 at time of writing) by comparing their topology, additional domains, and their assembly and misassembly reactions.}

ABSTRACT = {Jumbo phages have attracted much attention by virtue of their extraordinary genome size and unusual aspects of biology. By performing a comparative genomics analysis of 224 jumbo phages, we suggest an objective inclusion criterion based on genome size distributions and present a synthetic overview of their manifold adaptations across major biological systems. By means of clustering and principal component analysis of the phyletic patterns of conserved genes, all known jumbo phages can be classified into three higher-order groups, which include both myoviral and siphoviral morphologies indicating multiple independent origins from smaller predecessors. Our study uncovers several under-appreciated or unreported aspects of the DNA replication, recombination, transcription and virion maturation systems. Leveraging sensitive sequence analysis methods, we identify novel protein-modifying enzymes that might help hijack the host-machinery. Focusing on host&ndash;virus conflicts, we detect strategies used to counter different wings of the bacterial immune system, such as cyclic nucleotide- and NAD+-dependent effector-activation, and prevention of superinfection during pseudolysogeny. We reconstruct the RNA-repair systems of jumbo phages that counter the consequences of RNA-targeting host effectors. These findings also suggest that several jumbo phage proteins provide a snapshot of the systems found in ancient replicons preceding the last universal ancestor of cellular life.},

Originally established in 1971 as a resource for protein crystallographers to freely exchange data, today PDB data drive research and education across scientific disciplines. In 2011, the online portal PDB-101 was launched to support teachers, students, and the general public in PDB archive exploration (pdb101.rcsb.org). Maintained by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics PDB, PDB-101 aims to help train the next generation of PDB users and to promote the overall importance of structural biology and protein science to nonexperts. Regularly published features include the highly popular Molecule of the Month series, 3D model activities, molecular animation videos, and educational curricula. Materials are organized into various categories (Health and Disease, Molecules of Life, Biotech and Nanotech, and Structures and Structure Determination) and searchable by keyword. A biennial health focus frames new resource creation and provides topics for annual video challenges for high school students. Web analytics document that PDB-101 materials relating to fundamental topics (e.g., hemoglobin, catalase) are highly accessed year-on-year. In addition, PDB-101 materials created in response to topical health matters (e.g., Zika, measles, coronavirus) are well received. PDB-101 shows how learning about the diverse shapes and functions of PDB structures promotes understanding of all aspects of biology, from the central dogma of biology to health and disease to biological energy.},

The geometric constraints defining these container designs, and their implications for viral evolution, are open problems in virology. The principle of quasi-equivalence is currently used to predict virus architecture, but improved imaging techniques have revealed increasing numbers of viral outliers. We show that this theory is a special case of an overarching design principle for icosahedral, as well as octahedral, architectures that can be formulated in terms of the Archimedean lattices and their duals. These surface structures encompass different blueprints for capsids with the same number of structural proteins, as well as for capsid architectures formed from a combination of minor and major capsid proteins, and are recurrent within viral lineages. They also apply to other icosahedral structures in nature, and offer alternative designs for man-made materials and nanocontainers in bionanotechnology.},

However, despite its many successes, it fails to describe the relative angular orientations of proteins, as well as their radial mass distribution within the capsid. It also fails to provide any critical insight into sites of stability, modifications or possible mutations. We show how classifying spherical viruses using icosahedral point arrays, introduced by Keef and Twarock, unveils new geometric rules and constraints for understanding virus stability and key locations for exterior and interior modifications. We present a modified fitness measure which classifies viruses in an unambiguous and rigorous manner, irrespective of local surface chemistry, steric hinderance, solvent accessibility or Triangulation number. We then use these point arrays to explain the immutable surface loops of bacteriophage MS2, the relative reactivity of surface lysine residues in CPMV and the non-quasi-equivalent flexibility of the HBV dimers. We then explain how point arrays can be used as a predictive tool for site-directed modifications of capsids. This success builds on our previous work showing that viruses place their protruding features along the great circles of the asymmetric unit, demonstrating that viruses indeed adhere to these geometric constraints.},

To address this limit, we use simulations in combination with a simplified energetic model to study complex rearrangements in a large assembly. We use cryo-EM reconstructions to simulate the DNA packaging-associated 3 nm expansion of the protein shell of an initially assembled phage T7 capsid (called procapsid or capsid I). This is accompanied by a disorder-order transition and expansion-associated externalization displacement of the 420 N-terminal tails of the shell proteins. For the simulations, we use an all-atom structure-based model (1.07 million atoms), which is specifically designed to probe the influence of molecular sterics on dynamics. We find that the rate at which the N-terminal tails undergo translocation depends heavily on their position within hexons and pentons. Specifically, trans-shell displacements of the hexon E subunits are the most frequent and hexon A subunits are the least frequent. The simulations also implicate numerous tail translocation intermediates during tail translocation that involve topological traps, as well as sterically induced barriers.

   abstract = {The successful assembly of a closed protein shell (or capsid) is a key step in the replication of viruses and in the production of artificial viral cages for bio/nanotechnological applications. During self-assembly, the favorable binding energy competes with the energetic cost of the growing edge and the elastic stresses generated due to the curvature of the capsid. As a result, incomplete structures such as open caps, cylindrical or ribbon-shaped shells may emerge, preventing the successful replication of viruses. Using elasticity theory and coarse-grained simulations, we analyze the conditions required for these processes to occur and their significance for empty virus self-assembly. We find that the outcome of the assembly can be recast into a universal phase diagram showing that viruses with high mechanical resistance cannot be self-assembled directly as spherical structures. The results of our study justify the need of a maturation step and suggest promising routes to hinder viral infections by inducing mis-assembly.},

The coat proteins of these viruses, which have the HK97 fold, co-assemble with a free or attached scaffolding protein and other capsid proteins into a precursor capsid, known as a procapsid or prohead. The procapsid is a metastable state that increases in stability as a result of morphological changes that occur during the dsDNA packaging reaction. We review evidence from several systems indicating that proper contacts acquired in the assembly of the procapsid are critical to forming the correct morphology in the mature capsid.},

   abstract = {One of the crucial steps in the viral replication cycle is the self-assembly of its protein shell. Typically, each native virus adopts a unique architecture, but the coat proteins of many viruses have the capability to self-assemble in vitro into different structures by changing the assembly conditions. However, the mechanisms determining which of the possible capsid shapes and structures is selected by a virus are still not well-known. We present a coarse-grained model to analyze and understand the physical mechanisms controlling the size and structure selection in the assembly of empty viral capsids. Using this model and Monte Carlo simulations, we have characterized the phase diagram and stability of T = 1,3,4,7 and snub cube shells. In addition, we have studied the tolerance of different shells to changes in physical parameters related to ambient conditions, identifying possible strategies to induce misassembly or failure. Finally, we discuss the factors that select the shape of a capsid as spherical, faceted, elongated, or decapsidated. Our model sheds important light on the ingredients that control the assembly and stability of viral shells. This knowledge is essential to get capsids with well-defined size and structure that could be used for promising applications in medicine or bionanotechnology.},

Here we investigate the assembly of two computationally designed, 120-subunit icosahedral complexes in detail using several complementary biochemical methods.

However, the insertion of the final subunits is the rate-limiting, energetically unfavorable step in viral capsid assembly.

Instead of being built from one type of capsid protein (CP), they code for multiple distinct structural proteins that either break the local symmetry of the CP building blocks (capsomers) in specific positions or exhibit auxiliary proteins that stabilize the capsid shell. We investigate here the hypothesis that this occurs as a response to mechanical stress. For this, we construct a coarse-grained model of a viral capsid, derived from the experimentally determined atomistic positions of the CPs, that represents the basic features of protein organization in the viral capsid as described in Caspar-Klug theory. We focus here on viruses in the PRD1-adenovirus lineage. For T = 28 viruses in this lineage, which have capsids formed from two distinct structural proteins, we show that the tangential shear stress in the viral capsid concentrates at the sites of local symmetry breaking. In the T = 21, 25 and 27 capsids, we show that stabilizing proteins decrease the tangential stress. These results suggest that mechanical properties can act as selective pressures on the evolution of capsid components, offsetting the coding cost imposed by the need for such additional protein components.},

These salient aspects of a viral life cycle are hence well described and rationalised from a mesoscopic perspective. Accordingly, various experimental and computational efforts have been directed towards identifying the fundamental building blocks that are instrumental for the mechanical response, or constitute the assembly units, of a few specific viral shells. Motivated by these earlier studies we introduce and apply a general and efficient computational scheme for identifying the stable domains of a given viral capsid. The method is based on elastic network models and quasi-rigid domain decomposition. It is first applied to a heterogeneous set of well-characterized viruses (CCMV, MS2, STNV, STMV) for which the known mechanical or assembly domains are correctly identified. The validated method is next applied to other viral particles such as L-A, Pariacoto and polyoma viruses, whose fundamental functional domains are still unknown or debated and for which we formulate verifiable predictions. The numerical code implementing the domain decomposition strategy is made freely available.},

In fact, the relative displacements of few dynamical domains usually suffice to rationalize the mechanics underpinning biological functionality in proteins and can even be exploited for structure determination or refinement purposes. Here we present SPECTRUS, a general scheme that, by solely using amino acid distance fluctuations, can pinpoint the innate quasi-rigid domains of single proteins or large complexes in a robust way. Consistent domains are usually obtained by using either a pair of representative structures or thousands of conformers. The functional insights offered by the approach are illustrated for biomolecular systems of very different size and complexity such as kinases, ion channels, and viral capsids.

abstract = {Abstract Elastic network models have been successful in elucidating the largest scale collective motions of proteins. These models are based on a set of highly coupled springs, where only the close neighboring amino acids interact, without any residue specificity. Our objective here is to determine whether the equivalent cooperative motions can be obtained upon further coarse-graining of the protein structure along the backbone. The influenza virus hemagglutinin A (HA), composed of N=1509 residues, is utilized for this analysis. Elastic network model calculations are performed for coarse-grained HA structures containing only N/2, N/10, N/20, and N/40 residues along the backbone. High correlations (>0.95) between residue fluctuations are obtained for the first dominant (slowest) mode of motion between the original model and the coarse-grained models. In the case of coarse-graining by a factor of 1/40, the slowest mode shape for HA is reconstructed for all residues by successively selecting different subsets of residues, shifting one residue at a time. The correlation for this reconstructed first mode shape with the original all-residue case is 0.73, while the computational time is reduced by about three orders of magnitude. The reduction in computational time will be much more significant for larger targeted structures. Thus, the dominant motions of protein structures are robust enough to be captured at extremely high levels of coarse-graining. And more importantly, the dynamics of extremely large complexes are now accessible with this new methodology. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 23: 119–127, 2002},

Its main utility is to predict and visualize the collective motions of large complexes and assemblies near their equilibrium structures.

We now provide a new version (ANM 2.0), which allows inclusion of nucleic acids and ligands in the network model and thus enables the investigation of the collective motions of protein-DNA/RNA and -ligand systems. The new version offers the flexibility of defining the system nodes and the interaction types and cutoffs. It also includes extensive improvements in hardware, software and graphical interfaces.

   abstract = {Viruses are submicroscopic biological entities that need to infect a host cell in order to replicate. In their simplest form viruses are constituted by an infective genetic material and a protein shell (the capsid) that protects the viral genome. In this thesis we try to elucidate the general physical principles playing a major role in the morphology, stability, and assembly of viral capsids. Therefore, in the first part of the thesis, we develop a general theory that characterizes spherical and bacilliform (or prolate) capsids based on icosahedral symmetry under the same geometrical framework. In addition, we demonstrate that the structures derived in this geometrical study are obtained spontaneously from the free energy minimization of a very generic interaction among the viral capsomers of the capsid. In the second part of the thesis, we analyze the role of the discrete nature of capsids and the organization of capsomers in the actual mechanical properties of shells. We show that the icosahedral class P influences the stability and mechanical response of the quasi-spherical capsids. We also determine that under expansion, spherical shells tend to produce polyhedral structures (buckling), which are more resistant, and it is in consonance with the maturation process observed in some viruses. We also unveil the existence of built-in stress in the empty procapsids of the elongated bacteriophage φ29. This phenomenon is intimately related to the discrete nature of the structure, and reinforces the mechanical properties of the shell inverting the classical anisotropic response expected from continuum elasticity theory. In the last part of the thesis, we show that viral assembly and disassembly are activated processes controlled by nucleation barrier, which can be explained adapting classical nucleation theory (CNT). We focus on the case of spherical shells and confirm that the underlying assumptions of CNT are surprisingly good in characterizing the assembly of discrete shells, using the physical model introduced in the previous parts. Finally, we also unveil an interesting closure mechanism during the assembly of capsids.},

   abstract = {The shape and mechanical properties of viral capsids play an important role in several biological processes during the virus life cycle. In particular, to become infective, many viruses require a maturation stage where the capsid undergoes a buckling transition, from an initial spherical procapsid into a final icosahedral faceted shell. Here we study, using a minimal physical model, how the capsid shape and the buckling transition depend on the triangulation number T and the icosahedral class P of the virus structure. We find that, for small shells, capsids with P = 1 are most likely to produce polyhedral shapes that minimize their energy and accumulated stress, whereas viruses with P = 3 prefer to remain spherical. For big capsids, all shells are more stable adopting an icosahedral shape, in agreement with continuum elastic theory. Moreover, spherical viruses show a buckling transition to polyhedral shells under expansion, in consonance with virus maturation. The resulting icosahedral shell is mechanically stiffer, tolerates larger expansions and withstands higher internal pressures before failing, which could explain why some dsDNA viruses, which rely on the pressurization of their genetic material to facilitate the infection, undergo a buckling transition. We emphasize that the results are general and could also be applied to non-biological systems. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We present here a minimal model for equilibrium capsid structure, introducing an explicit interaction between protein multimers (capsomers). Using Monte Carlo simulation we show that the model reproduces the main structures of viruses in vivo (T-number icosahedra) and important nonicosahedral structures (with octahedral and cubic symmetry) observed in vitro. Our model can also predict capsid strength and shed light on genome release mechanisms.},

abstract = {Summary Viruses play a role in a significant portion of human diseases, as well as those of other animals, plants, and bacteria. This chapter focuses on the use of theoretical and computational modeling to understand the viral assembly process. It provides overviews of virus structure, assembly, and the experiments used to characterize the assembly process. An equilibrium analysis of the assembly of empty protein shells is performed. The chapter presents simple mathematical representation of the assembly process and its relevant timescales. This is followed by several types of modeling approaches that have been used to analyze and predict in vitro assembly kinetics. The chapter extends the equilibrium and dynamical approaches to consider the co-assembly of capsid proteins with RNA or other polyanionic cargoes. It concludes with some of the important open questions and ways in which modeling can make a stronger connection with experiments.}
