   abstract = {Viruses are submicroscopic biological entities that need to infect a host cell in order to replicate. In their simplest form viruses are constituted by an infective genetic material and a protein shell (the capsid) that protects the viral genome. In this thesis we try to elucidate the general physical principles playing a major role in the morphology, stability, and assembly of viral capsids. Therefore, in the first part of the thesis, we develop a general theory that characterizes spherical and bacilliform (or prolate) capsids based on icosahedral symmetry under the same geometrical framework. In addition, we demonstrate that the structures derived in this geometrical study are obtained spontaneously from the free energy minimization of a very generic interaction among the viral capsomers of the capsid. In the second part of the thesis, we analyze the role of the discrete nature of capsids and the organization of capsomers in the actual mechanical properties of shells. We show that the icosahedral class P influences the stability and mechanical response of the quasi-spherical capsids. We also determine that under expansion, spherical shells tend to produce polyhedral structures (buckling), which are more resistant, and it is in consonance with the maturation process observed in some viruses. We also unveil the existence of built-in stress in the empty procapsids of the elongated bacteriophage φ29. This phenomenon is intimately related to the discrete nature of the structure, and reinforces the mechanical properties of the shell inverting the classical anisotropic response expected from continuum elasticity theory. In the last part of the thesis, we show that viral assembly and disassembly are activated processes controlled by nucleation barrier, which can be explained adapting classical nucleation theory (CNT). We focus on the case of spherical shells and confirm that the underlying assumptions of CNT are surprisingly good in characterizing the assembly of discrete shells, using the physical model introduced in the previous parts. Finally, we also unveil an interesting closure mechanism during the assembly of capsids.},

   abstract = {The shape and mechanical properties of viral capsids play an important role in several biological processes during the virus life cycle. In particular, to become infective, many viruses require a maturation stage where the capsid undergoes a buckling transition, from an initial spherical procapsid into a final icosahedral faceted shell. Here we study, using a minimal physical model, how the capsid shape and the buckling transition depend on the triangulation number T and the icosahedral class P of the virus structure. We find that, for small shells, capsids with P = 1 are most likely to produce polyhedral shapes that minimize their energy and accumulated stress, whereas viruses with P = 3 prefer to remain spherical. For big capsids, all shells are more stable adopting an icosahedral shape, in agreement with continuum elastic theory. Moreover, spherical viruses show a buckling transition to polyhedral shells under expansion, in consonance with virus maturation. The resulting icosahedral shell is mechanically stiffer, tolerates larger expansions and withstands higher internal pressures before failing, which could explain why some dsDNA viruses, which rely on the pressurization of their genetic material to facilitate the infection, undergo a buckling transition. We emphasize that the results are general and could also be applied to non-biological systems. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The lack of tailed phages forming the common icosahedral capsid architectures T = 1 and T = 3 is puzzling. Here, we extracted geometrical features from high-resolution tailed phage capsid reconstructions and built a statistical model based on physical principles to predict the capsid diameter and genome length of the missing small-tailed phage capsids. We applied the model to 3348 isolated tailed phage genomes and 1496 gut metagenome-assembled tailed phage genomes. Four isolated tailed phages were predicted to form T = 3 icosahedral capsids, and twenty-one metagenome-assembled tailed phages were predicted to form T < 3 capsids. The smallest capsid predicted was a T = 4/3 ≈ 1.33 architecture. No tailed phages were predicted to form the smallest icosahedral architecture, T = 1.

Originally established in 1971 as a resource for protein crystallographers to freely exchange data, today PDB data drive research and education across scientific disciplines. In 2011, the online portal PDB-101 was launched to support teachers, students, and the general public in PDB archive exploration (pdb101.rcsb.org). Maintained by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics PDB, PDB-101 aims to help train the next generation of PDB users and to promote the overall importance of structural biology and protein science to nonexperts. Regularly published features include the highly popular Molecule of the Month series, 3D model activities, molecular animation videos, and educational curricula. Materials are organized into various categories (Health and Disease, Molecules of Life, Biotech and Nanotech, and Structures and Structure Determination) and searchable by keyword. A biennial health focus frames new resource creation and provides topics for annual video challenges for high school students. Web analytics document that PDB-101 materials relating to fundamental topics (e.g., hemoglobin, catalase) are highly accessed year-on-year. In addition, PDB-101 materials created in response to topical health matters (e.g., Zika, measles, coronavirus) are well received. PDB-101 shows how learning about the diverse shapes and functions of PDB structures promotes understanding of all aspects of biology, from the central dogma of biology to health and disease to biological energy.},

However, despite its many successes, it fails to describe the relative angular orientations of proteins, as well as their radial mass distribution within the capsid. It also fails to provide any critical insight into sites of stability, modifications or possible mutations. We show how classifying spherical viruses using icosahedral point arrays, introduced by Keef and Twarock, unveils new geometric rules and constraints for understanding virus stability and key locations for exterior and interior modifications. We present a modified fitness measure which classifies viruses in an unambiguous and rigorous manner, irrespective of local surface chemistry, steric hinderance, solvent accessibility or Triangulation number. We then use these point arrays to explain the immutable surface loops of bacteriophage MS2, the relative reactivity of surface lysine residues in CPMV and the non-quasi-equivalent flexibility of the HBV dimers. We then explain how point arrays can be used as a predictive tool for site-directed modifications of capsids. This success builds on our previous work showing that viruses place their protruding features along the great circles of the asymmetric unit, demonstrating that viruses indeed adhere to these geometric constraints.},

To address this limit, we use simulations in combination with a simplified energetic model to study complex rearrangements in a large assembly. We use cryo-EM reconstructions to simulate the DNA packaging-associated 3 nm expansion of the protein shell of an initially assembled phage T7 capsid (called procapsid or capsid I). This is accompanied by a disorder-order transition and expansion-associated externalization displacement of the 420 N-terminal tails of the shell proteins. For the simulations, we use an all-atom structure-based model (1.07 million atoms), which is specifically designed to probe the influence of molecular sterics on dynamics. We find that the rate at which the N-terminal tails undergo translocation depends heavily on their position within hexons and pentons. Specifically, trans-shell displacements of the hexon E subunits are the most frequent and hexon A subunits are the least frequent. The simulations also implicate numerous tail translocation intermediates during tail translocation that involve topological traps, as well as sterically induced barriers. The presented study establishes a foundation for understanding the precise relationship between molecular structure and phage maturation.},

As a result, incomplete structures such as open caps, cylindrical or ribbon-shaped shells may emerge, preventing the successful replication of viruses. Using elasticity theory and coarse-grained simulations, we analyze the conditions required for these processes to occur and their significance for empty virus self-assembly. We find that the outcome of the assembly can be recast into a universal phase diagram showing that viruses with high mechanical resistance cannot be self-assembled directly as spherical structures.

Finally, we discuss the factors that select the shape of a capsid as spherical, faceted, elongated, or decapsidated. Our model sheds important light on the ingredients that control the assembly and stability of viral shells.

Using molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained models for capsid proteins, we show that the competition between the formation of full capsids and nonidealized structures is strongly dependent upon the protein concentration and temperature, occurring kinetically as a cascade of elementary reactions in which free monomers are added to the growing oligomers on a downhill free-energy landscape. However, the insertion of the final subunits is the rate-limiting, energetically unfavorable step in viral capsid assembly. A phase diagram has been constructed to show the regions where capsids or nonidealized structures are stable at each concentration and temperature. We anticipate that our findings will provide guidance in identifying suitable conditions required for in vitro viral capsid assembly experiments. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {The self-assembly of perfectly ordered closed shells is a challenging process involved in many biological and nanoscale systems. However, most of the aspects that determine their formation are still unknown. Here we investigate the growth of shells by simulating the assembly of spherical structures made of N identical subunits. Remarkably, we show that the formation and energetics of partially assembled shells are dominated by an effective line-tension that can be described in simple thermodynamic terms. In addition, we unveil two mechanisms that can prevent the correct formation of defect-free structures: hole implosion, which leads to a premature closure of the shell; and closure catastrophe, which causes a dramatic production of structural disorder during the later stages of the growth of big shells. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {The protein shells, or capsids, of nearly all spherelike viruses adopt icosahedral symmetry. In the present Letter, we propose a statistical thermodynamic model for viral self-assembly. We find that icosahedral symmetry is not expected for viral capsids constructed from structurally identical protein subunits and that this symmetry requires (at least) two internal “switching” configurations of the protein. Our results indicate that icosahedral symmetry is not a generic consequence of free energy minimization but requires optimization of internal structural parameters of the capsid proteins. © 2003 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Many larger and more complex viruses deviate from the capsid layouts predicted in the seminal Caspar-Klug theory of icosahedral viruses. Instead of being built from one type of capsid protein (CP), they code for multiple distinct structural proteins that either break the local symmetry of the CP building blocks (capsomers) in specific positions or exhibit auxiliary proteins that stabilize the capsid shell. We investigate here the hypothesis that this occurs as a response to mechanical stress. For this, we construct a coarse-grained model of a viral capsid, derived from the experimentally determined atomistic positions of the CPs, that represents the basic features of protein organization in the viral capsid as described in Caspar-Klug theory. We focus here on viruses in the PRD1-adenovirus lineage. For T = 28 viruses in this lineage, which have capsids formed from two distinct structural proteins, we show that the tangential shear stress in the viral capsid concentrates at the sites of local symmetry breaking. In the T = 21, 25 and 27 capsids, we show that stabilizing proteins decrease the tangential stress. These results suggest that mechanical properties can act as selective pressures on the evolution of capsid components, offsetting the coding cost imposed by the need for such additional protein components.},

In this paper we investigate the mechanical properties of viral capsids, calling explicit attention to the inhomogeneity of the shells that is inherent to their discrete and polyhedral nature. We calculate the distribution of stress in these capsids and analyze their response to isotropic internal pressure (arising, for instance, from genome confinement and/or osmotic activity). We compare our results with appropriate generalizations of classical (i.e., continuum) elasticity theory. We also examine competing mechanisms for viral shell failure, e.g., in-plane crack formation vs radial bursting. The biological consequences of the special stabilities and stress distributions of viral capsids are also discussed. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Summary Identifying dynamical, quasi-rigid domains in proteins provides a powerful means for characterizing functionally oriented structural changes via a parsimonious set of degrees of freedom. In fact, the relative displacements of few dynamical domains usually suffice to rationalize the mechanics underpinning biological functionality in proteins and can even be exploited for structure determination or refinement purposes. Here we present SPECTRUS, a general scheme that, by solely using amino acid distance fluctuations, can pinpoint the innate quasi-rigid domains of single proteins or large complexes in a robust way. Consistent domains are usually obtained by using either a pair of representative structures or thousands of conformers. The functional insights offered by the approach are illustrated for biomolecular systems of very different size and complexity such as kinases, ion channels, and viral capsids. The decomposition tool is available as a software package and web server at spectrus.sissa.it.},

abstract={In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Elastic network models have been successful in elucidating the largest scale collective motions of proteins. These models are based on a set of highly coupled springs, where only the close neighboring amino acids interact, without any residue specificity. Our objective here is to determine whether the equivalent cooperative motions can be obtained upon further coarse-graining of the protein structure along the backbone. The influenza virus hemagglutinin A (HA), composed of N=1509 residues, is utilized for this analysis. Elastic network model calculations are performed for coarse-grained HA structures containing only N/2, N/10, N/20, and N/40 residues along the backbone. High correlations (>0.95) between residue fluctuations are obtained for the first dominant (slowest) mode of motion between the original model and the coarse-grained models. In the case of coarse-graining by a factor of 1/40, the slowest mode shape for HA is reconstructed for all residues by successively selecting different subsets of residues, shifting one residue at a time. The correlation for this reconstructed first mode shape with the original all-residue case is 0.73, while the computational time is reduced by about three orders of magnitude. The reduction in computational time will be much more significant for larger targeted structures. Thus, the dominant motions of protein structures are robust enough to be captured at extremely high levels of coarse-graining. And more importantly, the dynamics of extremely large complexes are now accessible with this new methodology. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 23: 119–127, 2002},

abstract = {Fluctuations about the native conformation of proteins have proven to be suitably reproduced with a simple elastic network model, which has shown excellent agreement with a number of different properties for a wide variety of proteins. This scalar model simply investigates the magnitudes of motion of individual residues in the structure. To use the elastic model approach further for developing the details of protein mechanisms, it becomes essential to expand this model to include the added details of the directions of individual residue fluctuations. In this paper a new tool is presented for this purpose and applied to the retinol-binding protein, which indicates enhanced flexibility in the region of entry to the ligand binding site and for the portion of the protein binding to its carrier protein.}
