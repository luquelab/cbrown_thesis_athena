My name is Colin Brown, an MS student in Physics, and this repository contains a record of my contributions to the lab and
the development of my thesis. I primarily analyze the structural properties of viral capsids with coarse grained models.
The majority of the content here will be a part of my Masters Thesis in Physics.
